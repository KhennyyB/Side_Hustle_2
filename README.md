# Style Guide
## Project Instructions
- Ensure you watch the lesson videos for weeks 4, 5, and 6 and attend week 5 and 6 live classes before starting this project.
- Use bootstrap or any other framework to make the form section responsive.
- For the navigation bar section, no framework including bootstrap should be used. Use your custom CSS styling to make it responsive.
- All input fields in the form section must be validated with vanilla javascript only, no validation library must be used.
- The input field for the password must have an eye icon so that when it's clicked, the user can hide or show the password.
